# ✅ TODO LIST APP

📝 This is a simple **TodoList application** built with **HTML, CSS**, and **JavaScript**. However, what makes it special is that it uses **ReactJS and Redux principles**, but **recreated manually in a minimalistic way without any external libraries**. Everything is **handcrafted** — from the store structure to state management — while still maintaining all the essential features of a modern todo app.

## 🔧 Features

- ➕ **Add Tasks** – Create new tasks quickly and easily.
- ✅ **Toggle Completion** – Mark tasks as done or undo them anytime.
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks** – Remove individual tasks from the list.
- 🎯 **Filter Tasks** – View all, active, or completed tasks.
- 🔁 **Toggle All** – Mark all tasks as completed or reset them.
- 🧹 **Clear Completed** – Instantly remove all completed tasks.
- ✏️ **Edit Tasks** – Double-click to edit existing tasks.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are saved using `localStorage` so nothing is lost on page reload.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🧠 JavaScript (ES6+)
- 🎨 HTML5
- 💅 CSS3
- 🗃️ LocalStorage
- ⚛️ ReactJS & Redux (Handmade)

## 🚀 How It Works

- Built from scratch without external libraries.
- Custom Redux-style reducer handles all state changes.
- LocalStorage is updated automatically when the task list changes.
- All UI updates reactively based on current state.

## 📜 How to Use

1. 🖱️ Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. 💬 Type in a task and press Enter to add it.
3. ✅ Click the checkbox to toggle completion.
4. 🧹 Use the filter buttons to view different task sets.
5. ✏️ Double-click a task to edit it.
6. 🔥 Try clearing completed tasks and see the magic!


## 💡 Notes
